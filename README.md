# Intro to Scuttlebutt: ssb-client

_Part of a series of tutorials being collected into the [scuttlebutt-guide](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebutt-guide)_

The aim of this code is to provide some examples about how to use `ssb-client`.

This code was written in a Twitch session. Watch it here : https://youtu.be/D9A06DhQ8aw

We cover:
- setting up a scuttlebot
- where does `ssb-client` fit in the ecosystem ([1:00](https://youtu.be/D9A06DhQ8aw?t=60))
- connecting to scuttlbot, and running: 
  - `whoami` ([10:32](https://youtu.be/D9A06DhQ8aw?t=632))
  - `createFeedStream` ([26:18](https://youtu.be/D9A06DhQ8aw?t=1578))
  - `createUserStream` ([48:27](https://youtu.be/D9A06DhQ8aw?t=2907))
- basics of pull-streams ([16:41](https://youtu.be/D9A06DhQ8aw?t=1001))

There's a summary of where we go to with the final js file (#4) at [1:17:46](https://youtu.be/D9A06DhQ8aw?t=4661)

:warning: This code assumes you already have content in your ssb database (from using Patchwork or similar)

## Feedback

I'm still learning - learning about how to weave scuttle code, and learning about how to introduce others to it.

If you have aternative solutions you'd like to share, or feedback on the method or format, I'd love to hear.
