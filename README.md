# Intro to Scuttlebutt: ssb-client

Part of a series of tutorials being collected into the [scuttlebutt-guide](https://github.com/ssbc/scuttlebutt-guide)

The aim of this code is to provide some examples about how to use `ssb-client`. We cover:
- setting up a scuttlebot
- where does `ssb-client` fit in the ecosystem ([1:00](https://youtu.be/D9A06DhQ8aw?t=60))
- connecting to scuttlbot, and running: 
  - `whoami` ([10:32](https://youtu.be/D9A06DhQ8aw?t=632))
  - `createFeedStream` ([26:18](https://youtu.be/D9A06DhQ8aw?t=1578))
  - `createUserStream` ([48:27](https://youtu.be/D9A06DhQ8aw?t=2907))
- basics of pull-streams ([16:41](https://youtu.be/D9A06DhQ8aw?t=1001))

_This code assumes you already have content in your ssb database (from using Patchwork or similar)_

Here's a recording of the twitch stream that generated this.

Use the timestamp links above to look for certain topics in context. There's a summary of where we go to with the final js file (#4) at [1:17:46](https://youtu.be/D9A06DhQ8aw?t=4661)

## Feedback

I'm still learning - learning about how to weave scuttle code, and learning about how to introduce others to it.

If you have aternative solutions you'd like to share, or feedback on the method or format, I'd love to hear.
